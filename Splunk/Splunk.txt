Splunk Enterprise Components

Splunk components are broadly divided into two categories:

    1. Processing Components
    These components are responsible for handling, processing, and storing the data.

    - Search Head
    - Handles all search-related activities.
    - Hosts the Splunk Web interface.
    - In highly distributed environments, multiple search heads are used for scalability.

    - Forwarders
    - Responsible for collecting and forwarding data to indexers.
    - Do basic parsing and data pre-processing.
    - Types:
        - Universal Forwarder (UF) – Lightweight, used for raw data forwarding.
        - Heavy Forwarder (HF) – Capable of parsing and filtering data before sending.

    - Indexer
    - Parses incoming data into events (i.e., rows of data).
    - Indexes the events and stores them in time-based buckets.
    - Enables fast search and retrieval of data.

    2. Management Components
    These components manage and monitor the Splunk environment.

    - Indexer Clusters
    - Composed of a Cluster Manager and Indexer Nodes.
    - Provides high availability and data replication across indexers.

    - Monitoring Console
    - Provides insights into the health and performance of the Splunk environment.

    - License Manager
    - Manages Splunk license usage.
    - All Splunk components communicate with the License Manager to verify license entitlement.

    - Deployment Server
    - Manages configurations and software updates for Splunk Universal Forwarders.
    - Handles deployment of updates and patches across managed instances.

    - Deployer
    - Used to distribute configurations and apps to members of a Search Head Cluster in distributed environments.

Splunk Configuration Management

    Splunk is largely managed via configuration files, which control:
    - System settings
    - Indexing behavior
    - Data inputs/outputs
    - User authentication and authorization

    Key Configuration Files:

    inputs.conf    - Defines data inputs, such as file paths and source types.
    indexes.conf   - Manages index storage locations and retention policies.
    outputs.conf   - Defines forwarding behavior (e.g., where forwarders send data).
    props.conf     - Handles timestamp recognition, event breaking, and field extractions.

    example of configuration file 
        [monitor:///var/log/messages]
        disabled = 0
        sourcetype = unixlog

        Stanza Header ([monitor:///var/log/messages]): Specifies the file or directory Splunk should monitor.
        disabled = 0: Enables the monitoring input (setting this to 1 would disable it).
