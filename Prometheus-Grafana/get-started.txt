Think about it as a time series database with a powerful query language
    A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time-stamped or time series data. 
    Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time.
    A Time Series database is optimized for measuring change over time. 
    Properties that make time series data very different than other data workloads are data lifecycle management, summarization, and large range scans of many records.
